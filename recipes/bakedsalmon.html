    <h3>A plate of scrumptious, baked salmon. Hooooluy.</h3>
    <p>This baked salmon is a great recipe for beginners. This was my first time making fish and it was a hit.
         Even my 9-year-old daughter who wouldn't ever dream of eating fish had half of my portion!</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>

        <li>Whisk olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, parsley, basil, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
